This is my attempt at the Codecademy 'Computer Science Independent Project #1 - Coin Flip'.
The full problem statement can be found at: https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/computer-science-independent-project-1-coin-flip/419951

Roughly, the coin_slip.py script contains three functions: coin_flip_game, dice_roll_game, and coin_or_dice_game.
Currently, running the script will run the coin_or_dice_game function.

The coin_flip_game asks you to guess whether a coin flip will come up heads or tails and tells you if you were correct or not.
You can play multiple times and it keeps track of your successes and the number of games played.

The dice_roll_game game does the same with a dice roll.

The coin_or_dice_game allows you to choose between flipping a coin and rolling a die. You can change between at any time.
