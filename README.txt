This is my attempt at the Codecademy 'Computer Science Independent Project #1 - Coin Flip'.
The full problem statement can be found at: https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/computer-science-independent-project-1-coin-flip/419951

Running the script will allow you play a game where you guess the outcome of either a coin flip or die roll.
The game allows you to play multiple times and counts the number of plays and how many times you've won.
